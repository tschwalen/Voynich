	In the trasciption file, each page is marked by what sort of illustration appears. The codes are as follows:
	A    Astronomical (excluding zodiac)
	B    Biological
	C    Cosmological
	H    Herbal
	P    Pharmaceutical
	S    Marginal stars only
	T    Text‚Äêonly page (no illustrations)
	Z    Zodiac
	
	(I'm going to ignore "Text Only because the illustrations is what I'm most interested in here")

	The labels might be a little arbitrary (I haven't seen all of the MS illustrations) but in any case, separating 
	them now allows me to do both fine grained and coarse grained (combining categories like Astronomy and Cosmology)
	analysis should I choose to do so.
